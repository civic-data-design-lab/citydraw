# Crowdmap: Basic
This is an attempt to create the most basic example of a web map for crowdsourcing... anything that users can draw on a map (points, squares, circles, lines, polygons...).
It uses [Leaflet.draw](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw) ([demo](https://leaflet.github.io/Leaflet.draw/)), an extension of the [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html) javascript mapping library to enable users to draw shapes on a map and then inserts them in a [CartoDB table](https://cartodb.com/data/). The webmap is hosted on [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/), which allows you to host free static websites on github, the codesharing website that you're reading this on currently. The only permitted behaviour is for users to view previously submitted input and to submit their own input. Editing or deleting input is not permitted. Examples of possible implementations include:
 - [Mapping neighbourhood boundaries](http://bostonography.com/hoods) ([code](https://github.com/mjfoster83/neighborhoods)) 
 - [Collecting data on traffic safety issues](http://app01.cityofboston.gov/VZSafety/#_=_)
 - [Soliciting input on routes and points for better biking infrastructure](http://boston-cyclists-union.github.io/bikeways4everybody) (based on this workshop, [code here](https://github.com/radumas/bikeways4everybody))

# Guide
## Set Up Accounts and Fork Repository

1. Get a [github](https://github.com/join) and a [cartodb](https://cartodb.com/signup) account.
  + (*Optional*) Mac & Windows users can install the [Github Desktop Software](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Fork the repository by clicking on the [fork icon](#js-flash-container) at the top right of this page, like the image below. To learn more about forking, click [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
[![](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/fork_button.jpg)](#js-flash-container)  

## After Forking this Repository

1. Perform all the steps under the [CartoDB](#cartodb) heading, then.  
2. Modify the following variables in `index.html` (search for "TODO"), you can edit this after [cloning](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/), or you can edit directly in your web-browser by clicking on the [`index.html`](index.html) filename above and then clicking on the pencil icon in the top right.
   `cartoDBusername` to your cartodb username
   `cartoDBinsertfunction` to the name of your insert function
   `cartoDBtablename` to the name of your table in CartoDB
3. Go to http://YOURGITHUBUSERNAME.github.io/crowdmap-basic to see your own map, and start submitting data, you can see the submitted data by going to the data view for that table in your CartoDB account.
4. Modify the code to your whims ([now what?](#now-what)). 


## CartoDB

2. Create a new CartoDB dataset. The default dataset comes with the following fields: `{cartodb_id, the_geom, description, name}`
   Each row represents one submission from the map with the first field a unique id assigned by CartoDB to each geometry. `the_geom` is the geographic object. `description` is the user input description of the shape, and `name` is the user's name.
3. In the view for the table, click on the "SQL" tab on the write to execute arbitrary SQL.  
![Custom SQL tab](https://i.stack.imgur.com/HPEHG.png)
4. Copy and paste the contents of `insert_function.sql` ([located here](insert_function.sql)) into the sql pane, and then modify the name of the table to be inserted:  
	```
	_the_table TEXT := 'crowdmap_basic';
	```  
	This function allows you to send data from the map to the CartoDB using a publicly accessible URL while limiting what functions the public can perform on the data (for example, modifying or deleting existing data). This function takes the drawn shape as a GeoJSON, the description, and the username. It converts the GeoJSON to a PostGIS geometry object and then inserts a new row in the table with the geometry, and the other two user-input values. Since it isn't easy to view saved functions in cartoDB, I recommend saving the function in a text file.  
	**If you have multiple tables** see below for more information on keeping track of multiple files.
5. Return to step 2 in [**After Forking this Repository**](#after-forking-this-repository)  

**Multiple tables:** you need to create a unique function for each, it's probably a good idea to save each function as a separate file so you can recall what is on your CartoDB account. Alternatively you can see which functions have been created with the following `sql` query ([source](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1559039/4047679)):  
```sql  
SELECT  proname, proargnames, prosrc 
FROM    pg_catalog.pg_namespace n
JOIN    pg_catalog.pg_proc p
ON      p.pronamespace = n.oid
WHERE   n.nspname = 'public' 
AND		p.proowner <> 10
```	 

# Now What?
What to do and modify on your map once it's working. Have a look at the different parameters in the `config` variable in [`index.html`](index.html) to get a sense of what you can modify:
 - **Where the map is focused** on with the `mapcenter` parameter
 - **The shapes that can be drawn** (line, marker, etc...) under the `drawOptions` parameters. See more Leaflet.Draw options [here](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw#options)  
     + You can also enable editing and deleting of shapes, however this will require additional configuration of the function that communicates with the CartoDB database, see [this CartoDB tutorial](http://blog.cartodb.com/read-and-write-to-cartodb-with-the-leaflet-draw-plugin/) for more details. (**Note**: that CartoDB example may be vulnerable to SQL Injection, see [here](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/49699/sql-injection-in-postgres-functions-vs-prepared-queries))
 - **The base map** (background) by modifying `var CartoDB_Positron = L.tileLayer(...)`, you can test a number [here](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/)
 - **The map style** (e.g. height, width, font) by modifying [`css/style.css`](css/style.css). See [this](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) quirky frog-based tutorial as an introduction to [Cascading Style Sheets](http://stackoverflow.com/a/9289668/4047679)
 - **[Advanced] what fields are collected.** This requires the modification of:
   + The table in CartoDB
   + The [`insert_function`](insert_function.sql) (and then re-executing this in CartoDB)
   + The field(s) used after `<div id="dialog" title="Tell us About this Drawing">` in `index.html`
   + The `setData()` function in `index.html`

Once you've collected data from users, have a look at the [tutorials at CartoDB](http://docs.cartodb.com/tutorials/) for what kinds of maps you can make from your data.

# How it works
## Sending Leaflet.draw data to CartoDB  

This section details the modifications made from the [excellent tutorial](http://duspviz.mit.edu/web-map-workshop/cartodb-data-collection/#) by Mike Foster ([@mjfoster83](https://github.com/mjfoster83/web-map-workshop)). If this is your first introduction to leaflet, you should probably go through the entire webmapping workshop  

2. Modify the `setData()` function to construct the SQL query which calls the function to insert the data to CartoDB.
   ```javascript
    //Convert the drawing to a GeoJSON to pass to the CartoDB sql database
    var drawing = "'"+JSON.stringify(layer.toGeoJSON().geometry)+"'";

    //Construct the SQL query to insert data from the three parameters: the drawing, 
    //the input username, and the input description of the drawn shape
    var sql = "SELECT insert_crowd_mapping_data(";
    sql += drawing;
    sql += ","+enteredDescription;
    sql += ","+enteredUsername;
    sql += ");";
    ```  
3. And then add the sql query to an AJAX call in order to pass the data to your CartoDB table
    ```javascript
    //TODO: Change to your username
    var cartoDBusername = "raphaeld"  
    //Sending the data
      $.ajax({
        type: 'POST',
        url: 'https://'+cartoDBusername+'.cartodb.com/api/v2/sql',
        crossDomain: true,
        data: {"q":sql},
        dataType: 'json',
        success: function(responseData, textStatus, jqXHR) {
          console.log("Data saved");

        },
        error: function (responseData, textStatus, errorThrown) {

            console.log("Problem saving the data");
        }
      });
    ```
4. After each new drawing is inserted, the data from the `drawnItems` layer is passed to the `CartoDBData` layer without re-querying the database. This does mean that a user **won't** see others' edits to the map after load. See Mike Foster's [tutorial](http://duspviz.mit.edu/web-map-workshop/cartodb-data-collection/#) for the easy fix to reload the data from CartoDB after every draw.
    ```javascript
    // Transfer drawing to the CartoDB layer
    var newData = layer.toGeoJSON();
      newData.properties.description = description.value;
      newData.properties.name = username.value;

    cartoDBData.addData(newData);
    ```
